# Joel-here-node

This is the backend for my main frontend project joel-here.

# Running the server

```
yarn dev
```

# env variables

For local dev you can create a `.env` file to handle env variables. It would look like this:

```
PORT=3000
API_KEY=your-api-key
DB_HOST=somehost
DB_USER=someuser
DB_PASS=somepassword
```

In prod these will be set up in the host.
